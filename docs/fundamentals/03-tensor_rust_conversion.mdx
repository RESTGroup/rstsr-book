# Tensor and Rust Type Conversions

Part of this documentation has been covered in the previous two sections ([Tensor Creation](01-tensor_creation.mdx) and [Tensor Deconstruction and Ownership](02-structure_and_ownership.mdx)). In particular, [Tensor Structure and Ownership](02-structure_and_ownership.mdx) focuses on explaining RSTSR's features through code examples.

When using tensor libraries, users often need to interact with other Rust types (including `Vec<T>`, `&[T]`, or other linear algebra libraries like Faer). This section systematically explains how to implement conversions between RSTSR tensors and other Rust types from a practical usage perspective.

This documentation only applies to CPU backends. Currently, other backend types have not been implemented. For future versions of RSTSR, this documentation may not apply to other backend types.

## 1. Conversions with `Vec<T>`

### 1.1 From `Vec<T>`: asarray

RSTSR's tensor `Tensor<T, B, D>` can be created from raw vector data, dimensions, and device information using the `rt::asarray` function. The `rt::asarray` function has multiple overloads, which will be detailed in future API documentation.

The following program stores raw data as a (2, 3)-dimensional tensor on a 16-core parallel OpenBLAS device. Note that this program behaves differently under row-major and column-major layouts:
```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_from_vec_by_asarray
```

### 1.2 From `Vec<T>`: Manual Construction

As mentioned in the previous section, RSTSR tensors have a multi-layered structure. While the `rt::asarray` function is intuitive, it hides the specific process of constructing RSTSR tensors.

The following program demonstrates how RSTSR step-by-step constructs a complete tensor from the basic `Vec<T>` data storage unit:
```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_from_vec_by_scratch
```

### 1.3 Into `Vec<T>`: into_vec Function

For CPU backends, this function can convert a 1-D tensor into a `Vec<T>` vector.

Please note the following **side effects**:

- This function prohibits converting higher-dimensional tensors (e.g., 2-D) into vectors:

    <div className="ferris-overlay">
    ```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_into_vec_by_into_vec_failed
    ```
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg")} alt="does_not_compile" title="Won't compile!" /> </div>

    If you genuinely need to convert higher-dimensional tensors into vectors, you must first use `into_shape` or `into_contig` to convert them into 1-D tensors.

- For `Tensor<T, B, D>` (tensors that own their data), this function typically does not copy data, meaning it has almost no runtime cost:

    ```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_into_vec_by_into_vec
    ```

    However, if the offset is non-zero, stride is not one, or the underlying data length does not match the dimension information, data will still be copied:

    ```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_into_vec_by_into_vec_cloned
    ```

- For reference types (e.g., `TensorView<'_, T, B, D>`), this function will copy data.

### 1.4 Into `Vec<T>`: Top-down Deconstruction

This discussion only applies to `Tensor<T, B, D>` (tensors that own their data).

RSTSR tensors can be constructed from scratch using `Vec<T>` or deconstructed top-down from `Tensor<T, B, D>`. Deconstructing a tensor requires calling `into_raw_parts` twice and `into_raw` once:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_into_vec_destruct
```

However, this function also has **side effects**. It only returns the underlying vector used for data storage, without considering how the vector's layout is stored. For tensors of any dimension (including higher-dimensional ones like 2-D), `into_raw_parts` can still extract the `Vec<T>` data, but this data may not match what the `into_vec` function returns. This can be demonstrated with tensors where the stride is not 1:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_into_vec_destruct_warn
```

Therefore, if you want to obtain `Vec<T>` through top-down deconstruction, you must ensure that the tensor or vector's layout meets your expectations.

### 1.5 To `Vec<T>`: to_vec Function

This function is essentially the same as `into_vec`, including its usage and side effects. It does not consume the input tensor but will always copy memory.

## 2. Conversions with `&[T]`/`&mut [T]` or Pointer Types

In Rust, `&[T]` (or `&mut [T]`) is very similar to pointer types: `&[T]` includes a length guarantee compared to pointers. Therefore, when you have a `*const T` pointer and a `usize` length in Rust, the approach is identical to working with `&[T]`.

### 2.1 From `&[T]`: asarray

Similar to `Vec<T>`, RSTSR's tensor view `TensorView<'_, T, B, D>` can be created using the `rt::asarray` function. However, unlike `Vec<T>`, it returns a tensor view `TensorView<'_, T, B, D>` rather than an owning tensor `Tensor<'_, T, B, D>`. Note that this program behaves differently under row-major and column-major layouts:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_from_ref_by_asarray
```

Similarly, `&mut [T]` can be used to create a mutable view `TensorMut<'_, T, B, D>` through a similar process.

### 2.2 From `&[T]`: Manual Construction

The approach here is consistent with manually constructing from `Vec<T>`. However, note that RSTSR's CPU backend always processes reference types as `&Vec<T>` rather than `&[T]`[^1]. Therefore, in RSTSR, we require first constructing a `Vec<T>` from `&[T]`; this vector will not be automatically dropped and will have lifetime annotations. Specifically:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_from_ref_by_scratch
```

Similarly, `&mut [T]` can be used to create a mutable view `TensorMut<'_, T, B, D>` through a similar process.

[^1]: RSTSR's storage of reference types differs from most current matrix or tensor libraries. Advanced users may find the following discussion interesting.

    :::info **About the Underlying Storage of Tensor View Types**

    RSTSR uses a simple approach to store owning and reference types:
    ```rust
    pub struct DataOwned<C> {
        pub(crate) raw: C,
    }

    pub enum DataRef<'a, C> {
        TrueRef(&'a C),
        ManuallyDropOwned(ManuallyDrop<C>),
    }
    ```
    For CPU backends, the generic parameter `C` typically refers to `Vec<T>`. This approach makes lifetime definitions clear, as everything can be described using `Vec<T>`, which is very convenient for library development.

    However, by definition, reference types should be `&[T]` rather than `&Vec<T>` (also refer to clippy [`ptr_arg`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#ptr_arg)). A pointer `*const T`, length, and lifetime can together represent a memory reference `&[T]`. Most matrix and tensor libraries, including ndarray, Faer, and nalgebra, define reference types this way.

    It's hard to say which approach is better. However, since RSTSR's backends may not be CPU-based (e.g., data could be stored on disk or GPU), and reference types for disk or GPU may not be describable using `&[T]` or pointers, RSTSR currently uses `&Vec<T>` to represent reference types. The side effect is that when users only have `&[T]` without the corresponding `Vec<T>`, they must first convert `&[T]` into a `Vec<T>` using ManuallyDrop (to avoid double free), constructing a `Vec<T>` that won't be dropped, and then reference it.

    The `rt::asarray` function encapsulates this process of converting `&[T]` into `Vec<T>` using ManuallyDrop. For common data types (e.g., `f64`, `Complex<f64>`), this typically has no impact. However, for types with destructors, users may need to be more careful when using RSTSR.

### 2.3 To `&Vec<T>`: raw Function

We can return a reference to the underlying data:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_to_ref_by_raw
```

This is essentially the same as top-down deconstruction to obtain `Vec<T>`, except that we only need a reference without deconstructing the tensor, so a simpler function `raw` can achieve this.

Similarly, for owning tensors `Tensor<T, B, D>` or mutable views `TensorMut<'_, T, B, D>`, the `raw_mut` function can be used to obtain a mutable reference `&mut Vec<T>`.

This function also has **side effects**.

:::warning **RSTSR Does Not Verify Layout for `raw`-Generated `&Vec<T>`**

This is the same as top-down deconstruction to obtain `Vec<T>`. RSTSR only returns a reference to the data; whether it complies with layout rules (e.g., c/f-contiguous) or whether the first element of the reference corresponds to the tensor's first element must be ensured by the user.

From this perspective, using the `raw` function is risky. However, since it does not involve memory safety, the function is not marked as unsafe. Users should still exercise caution when using `raw`.

A common mistake (even made by library developers) is failing to properly add offsets to pointers. We use the following Cholesky decomposition example to illustrate this. Suppose we have the following $3 \times 3$ f-contiguous matrix:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_raw_error_usage_1
```

If we want to perform a lower-triangular Cholesky decomposition on the bottom-right $2 \times 2$ submatrix, the standard approach in RSTSR is:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_raw_error_usage_2
```

Suppose we need to pass this to the `lapack` crate for Cholesky decomposition using other Rust types. In RSTSR, this can be done using the `raw_mut` function. However, **without adding the correct offset to the slice generated by `raw_mut`, the following call is incorrect!**

<div className="ferris-overlay">
```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_raw_error_usage_3
```
<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/ferris/not_desired_behavior.svg")} alt="not_desired_behavior" title="Unexpected behavior!" /> </div>

The correct approach requires adding an offset to the pointer returned by `raw_mut` to ensure the pointer passed to FFI points to the first element of `sub_mat`:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_raw_error_usage_4
```

:::

## 3. Conversions with Faer Types

Currently, RSTSR also supports conversions with a few other Rust types.

For Faer's `MatRef` and `MatMut`, RSTSR supports bidirectional conversions. Taking `MatRef` as an example, since it is a reference type, the process does not involve memory copying:

```rust file=../../listings/features-default/tests/tensor_rust_conversion.rs anchor=example_rstsr_faer_conversion
```
