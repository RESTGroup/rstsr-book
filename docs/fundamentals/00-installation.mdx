# Installation and Prelude

## For General Users

To use RSTSR, you may wish to install directly from cargo.
Simply add a line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
rstsr = { version = "0.1" }  # may change if RSTSR updates
```

And the common prelude usage is

```rust
use rstsr::prelude::*;
```

That's it! Then you can try the example code in [welcome page](index.mdx)!

You may wish to know how to use traits and functions in RSTSR, and we refer to [prelude guides](#prelude-guides) for this part.

You may also wish to use some advanced features in RSTSR, such as
