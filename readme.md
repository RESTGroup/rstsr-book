# Book for RSTSR project

This is the user document for [RSTSR](https://github.com/RESTGroup/rstsr) project, a rust tensor toolkit.

RSTSR has still not reached version 0.1, thus, this book is also in early development. Frequent changes will occur.

This document uses [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) toolchain. To compile this book, you may install third-party projects:
- [mdbook-katex](https://github.com/lzanini/mdbook-katex)
- [mdbook-theme](https://github.com/zjp-CN/mdbook-theme)

# Usage of other project sources
